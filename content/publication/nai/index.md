abstract: 'The paper surveys ongoing research on hyperdimensional computing and vector symbolic architectures which represent an alternative approach to neural computing with various advantages and interesting specific properties: transparency, error tolerance, sustainability. In particular, it can be demonstrated that hyperdimensional patterns are well-suited for the encoding of complex knowledge structures. Consequently, the related architectures offer perspectives for the development of innovative neurosymbolic models with a closer correspondence to cognitive processes in human brains. We revisit the fundamentals of hyperdimensional representations and examine some recent applications of related methods for analogical reasoning and learning tasks, with a particular focus on knowledge graphs. We then propose potential extensions and delineate prospective avenues for future investigations.'
