### [GRainsaCK](https://github.com/rbarile17/grainsack)
*A Comprehensive Software Library for Benchmarking Explanations of Link Prediction Tasks on Knowledge Graphs*

### [KG-SaF](https://github.com/ivandiliso/kg-saf)
*Building Complete Datasets for Machine Learning and Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs*

KG-SaF provides a workflow (KG-SaF-JDeX) and curated datasets (KG-SaF-Data) for knowledge graph refinement (KGR) research. The resource includes datasets with both schema (ontologies) and ground facts, making it ready for machine learning and reasoning services.

### [PyKEEN Negative Sampling Library](https://github.com/ivandiliso/refactor-negative-sampler)
*Enhancing PyKeen with Multiple Negative Sampling Solutions for Knowledge Graph Embedding Models*

It implements a negative sampling extension for PyKEEN, one of the most widely used and comprehensive libraries for knowledge graph embedding by introducing a suite of advanced negative sampling strategies for KGE models, all unified within a standardized, modular, and extensible architecture.

### [TransOWL & TransOWL-HRS](https://github.com/Keehl-Mihael/TransROWL-HRS)
*Injecting Background Knowledge into Embedding Models for Predictive Tasks on Knowledge Graphs*

Building on existing models such as TransE and TransR, it includes three semantically enriched variants:

* TransOWL injecting constraints in the loss function, accounting for equivalent properties, equivalent classes, class hierarchy, inverse properties
* TransROWL following the same formulation of TransOWL, but extending the TransR model
* TransOWL-HRS extending TransROWL with relation hierarchies and relation clusters
